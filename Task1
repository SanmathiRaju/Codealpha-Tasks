TASK 1

Student Grade Tracker

Develop a program that allows a teacher to enter students' grades and compute their average, highest, and lowest scores. You can use arrays or ArrayLists to store the student data.
code:import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StudentGradeTracker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        ArrayList<Integer> grades = new ArrayList<>();

        System.out.print("Enter the number of students: ");
        int numStudents = scanner.nextInt();

        for (int i = 0; i < numStudents; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter grade for student " + (i + 1) + ": ");
            int grade = scanner.nextInt();
            grades.add(grade);
        }

        int sum = 0;
        int highest = grades.get(0);
        int lowest = grades.get(0);

        for (int grade : grades) {
            sum += grade;
            if (grade > highest) {
                highest = grade;
            }
            if (grade < lowest) {
                lowest = grade;
            }
        }

        double average = (double) sum / grades.size();

        System.out.println("\n--- Grade Summary ---");
        System.out.println("Average Grade: " + average);
        System.out.println("Highest Grade: " + highest);
        System.out.println("Lowest Grade: " + lowest);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
Output
Enter the number of students: 5
Enter grade for student 1: 78
Enter grade for student 2: 85
Enter grade for student 3: 92
Enter grade for student 4: 67
Enter grade for student 5: 74

--- Grade Summary ---
Average Grade: 79.2
Highest Grade: 92
Lowest Grade: 67
